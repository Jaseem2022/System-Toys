# System Toys 🎮

**System Toys** is a sandbox Unity project where I experiment with fun gameplay mechanics inspired by popular games (Tracer’s rewind/blink, Junkrat’s trap, gravity flips, and more). The goal is to explore mechanics in isolation and build them into a toybox of systems.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This isn’t meant to be a polished game — it’s a **mechanics playground**.
Each “toy” is modular and can inspire mechanics for bigger projects later.
